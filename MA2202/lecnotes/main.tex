\section{Introduction}
This is a first course in Probability covering the following topics.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Basic Axioms of Probability
  \item Random Variables
  \item Inequalities
\end{itemize}
The reference we will be using is \emph{A First Course in Probability} by Sheldon Ross.
\section{The Birthday problem}
\begin{problem}[The Birthday Problem]
    Given n randomly chosen people in a room, what is the probability that two people share a birthday? A similar 
    restatement can be given that the probability that people share a birthday is above 50\%, 
    what will be the value of n (i.e. no of people in the room)?
\end{problem}
A somewhat counterintuitive answer for the restatement is that we only need 23 randomly chosen 
people in a room to get the probability of a birthday match to be above 50\%. We will actually 
plot a graph and show the probability for n people.
\begin{explanation}
  The proof of the answer is quite simple. Let E be the event that two people in the n people 
  share a birthday. Then we can easily calculate \(E^c\).
 \begin{align*}
     P(E^c) & = \frac{365}{365} \cdot \frac{364}{365} \cdots \frac{365-n}{365} \\ 
            & = \frac{^{365}P_n}{365^{23}} \\ 
     P(E) &= 1 - P(E^c)\\ 
          &= 1- \frac{^{365}P_n}{365^{23}}
 \end{align*}
 If we  put n = 23  we get P(\(E^c) \approx\)  0.507 which proves our result.
\end{explanation}
A graph \(P(E^c)\) vs n is shown below.
We can extend to something called the Probabilistic Pigeonhole Principle.
\begin{theorem}[The Probabilistic Pigeonhole Principle]
  Given n balls and m bins, and the probability that atleast two balls are in the same bin is 
  given by the inequality:
 \begin{align}
     n > \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{2m\log(\frac{1}{1-p})+\frac{1}{4}}
 \end{align}
\end{theorem}
\begin{explanation}
    We use a fairly random inequality \(e^{-x}\ge1-x \quad \forall x\in \R \).
\end{explanation}
\section{Axioms of Probability}
\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Random Experiment: } A random experiment is an experiment where a certain outcome
        has no effect on other outcomes when repeated multiple times.
    \item \emph{Mutually Exclusive: }
    \item \emph{Exhaustive: }
    \item \emph{Sample Space \(\Omega\): } A sample space is the set of all outcomes of a Random Experiment.
    \item \emph{Event Space \(\epsilon\): }
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Axioms}


\begin{itemize}
    \item If \(A\in\epsilon\),then \(A^c\in\epsilon\).
    \item \(\epsilon\) is closed under countable union.
    \item Let $P:\epsilon\rightarrow[0,1]$ be a function st if A and B are events s.t. 
       \(A,B\in \epsilon \) where \(A\cap B = \phi\) then 
       \(P(A\cup B) = P(A)+P(B)\).\\ 
       In general, if \(A_1, \dots, A_n\) are mutually exclusive, then \\ 
       \begin{center}
           \(P(\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{n}A_i) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}P(A_i)\)
       \end{center}
