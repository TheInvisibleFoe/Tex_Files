  abstract      = "Bayesian inference involves two main computational
                   challenges. First, in estimating the parameters of some
                   model for the data, the posterior distribution may well be
                   highly multi-modal: a regime in which the convergence to
                   stationarity of traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
                   techniques becomes incredibly slow. Second, in selecting
                   between a set of competing models the necessary estimation
                   of the Bayesian evidence for each is, by definition, a
                   (possibly high-dimensional) integration over the entire
                   parameter space; again this can be a daunting computational
                   task, although new Monte Carlo (MC) integration algorithms
                   offer solutions of ever increasing efficiency. Nested
                   sampling (NS) is one such contemporary MC strategy targeted
                   at calculation of the Bayesian evidence, but which also
                   enables posterior inference as a by-product, thereby
                   allowing simultaneous parameter estimation and model
                   selection. The widely-used MultiNest algorithm presents a
                   particularly efficient implementation of the NS technique
                   for multi-modal posteriors. In this paper we discuss
                   importance nested sampling (INS), an alternative summation
                   of the MultiNest draws, which can calculate the Bayesian
                   evidence at up to an order of magnitude higher accuracy than
                   `vanilla' NS with no change in the way MultiNest explores
                   the parameter space. This is accomplished by treating as a
                   (pseudo-)importance sample the totality of points collected
                   by MultiNest, including those previously discarded under the
                   constrained likelihood sampling of the NS algorithm. We
                   apply this technique to several challenging test problems
                   and compare the accuracy of Bayesian evidences obtained with
                   INS against those from vanilla NS.",
