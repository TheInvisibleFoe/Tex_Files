    \section{Introduction}
    The course introduces us to the fundamentals of thermal physics and will end with statistical
    physics. 
    
    \section{Internal energy of Ideal Gas}
    We use some elementary equations already taught in CH1201. We will be using the ideal gas 
    equation and the $1^{st}$ Law of Thermodynamics. 
    \begin{align*}
        PV &= NRT \\ 
        dU &= TdS - pdV + \mu dN
    \end{align*}
    We assume the fact that the internal energy of the system, something we will define later,
    depends on the variables entropy(S), volume(V) and no of moles(N). The first term of equation
    2 above change in heat energy $dQ = TdS$ and work done on the system $dW = -PdV$ and 
    chemical potential $\mu dN$. 
    \begin{align*}
        dU &= \pdv{U}{S}dS - \pdv{U}{V}dV + \pdv{U}{N}dN \\ 
        \tag{Comparing this to the first law} 
        T &= \pdv{U}{S}dS\\ 
        P &= - \pdv{U}{V}dV \\ 
        \mu &= \pdv{U}{N}dN 
    \end{align*}
    The chemical potential is a new term added in this course. %definition to added here:
    So chemical potential essentially refers to the change in internal energy on adding or 
    subtracting a molecule. Essentially when we add an infinitesimally small number of molecules
    say dN, we have the chemical potential term to be $\mu dN$.\\[5]
    \fbox{Goal: We need to find a closed form expression for the internal energy of an ideal gas}
    \\[5]
    We introduce one more equation into solving for the closed form expression i.e. the 
    equipartition of energy.
